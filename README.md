This is a ridiculaous name but the only one left in the cyber universe, judging by the number of options available. To work...

Well, not an easy question to answer in one part but here goes:
Proving Brooke's wrong!
Now with that behind us, the obvious question is how can we do this. Answer is obvious 
- get rid of duplication in all its forms(not to be confused with replication).  
Next question is how?
Once again, very simply - reduce everything (and I mean everything) to its foundational atomic components and then use an index to deliver a structure. Then index the structures to deliver compound structures. Repeat.
Next question - what is everything? 
By now you will hopefully understand software consists of algorithms and stuff (found inside code) and data -  data is fed to the algorithms and value added - what's expressed is data but with the changes as prescribed by the algorithm. Repat to deliver final requirement.
Now if everything is algorithms and data (later referred to as logic and rule) then is this all?
Nope. We forge to look beyond the paper and the dot. Remembver to include you looking at the paper and the dot. You define the requirement - in other words, you request an output or a outcome or define the structure.
To summarise, l;ogic and rule (cyber equivalent to electricity and matter) interact to deliver a unique structure - atomic structures associate to form compound structures. Repeat
Now to answer the original question (...👀 I'm interested in) here is a more serious answer - identifying mechanisms which reduce the index of reuse of logic by 100%. 

🌱 I’m currently learning ...
I have spent more time than most people are alive pursuing the abjective. Using metaobjects realised from basic atomic components, it can be demonstrated that an infinite number of structural phenotypes (Whew) can be realised using a finite number of logic componets - indexing is the secret! In essence, the focus is to do to logic (transitional aspect) what normalisation has done to rule (persistent aspect). Still learning how to make it more understandable. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
Well, here it becomes vague. The concept has been tested in a PhD, the executable provides output as would be expected, but explaining the 'engine' is really hard!  The problem is the work has been done in isolation. I have a limited understanding of mainstream terminology, and invented terms are not grasped by the reciepients. I would really appreciate an informal soundboard with an academic / industry specialist to classify the work. Who knows, it may be of vaue. What I can say is market products make use of existing structures, templates and generators. This approach was discarded in the 90's - granularity was too rough. Final approach as mentioned above can cated for subtypes, recusion and iterative requirements. Enough!
